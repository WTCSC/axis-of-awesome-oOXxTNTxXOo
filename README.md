# Axis of Awesome
My axis of awesome is geared towards helping gamers understand how they can improve as a gamer in the game Marvel Rivals. 

# How it function 
as of right now my Axis of Awsome works through manualy inputing your data in the Ranked list in the format of "Character, NumberOfDifCharactersPlayed, MatcTime/m:s, mode, map, Kills/finalhits, damage, deaths, assist, "kills", blocked, healing, Accuracy, RankedPoints, loss/gain, date(date, time), win/loss, mvp". Once your data is inputed you can use my defualt graphs to see if there are any patterns or discovers you can find from your data.
